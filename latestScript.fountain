>FADE IN:

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DUSK

The sprawling skyline transforms into a monochromatic marvel, bathed in twilight's soft hues. Neon signs flicker to life.

TITLE CARD: "TWENTY YEARS AGO"

INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Rows of CLUTTERED DESKS illuminated by computer screens. WORKERS toil in the blue glow.

TIME DISSOLVE - The office empties. ONE FIGURE remains, silhouetted against monitors. A MAN (30s) in a rumpled suit.

EXT. APARTMENT BALCONY - LATE NIGHT

High above the city, a WOMAN cradles a NEWBORN. She gazes into the night, worry etched on her face.

INT. APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

The MAN returns home. His WIFE waits with their baby. Morning sun filters through the window. A tired smile. A kiss.

EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - VARIOUS NIGHTS

MONTAGE: Night after night, the same routine. The man working late. Alone.

EXT. APARTMENT BALCONY - LATE NIGHT

The balcony stands EMPTY. No woman. No child. Just absence.

INT. APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

The man opens the door to SILENCE. His wife and child—gone. His face crumbles.

EXT. CITY STREET - NEXT MORNING

The man walks in a different direction. A STRAY CAT emerges, following his feet.

EXT. GUN STORE - DAY

A weathered storefront: "GUNS AND AMMO." The man enters.

INT. GUN STORE - DAY

CLOSE ON: A HANDGUN slides across the counter. Cash exchanged. No words.

INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

The man stands over his BOSS (50s), seated in a leather chair.

BOSS
Please... I didn't know they would—

BANG. The flash illuminates the man's cold expression.

He walks past the body to a SAFE. Swings it open. STACKS OF CASH inside.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATE NIGHT

The man in SUNGLASSES and a TRENCH COAT walks toward camera. Behind him, the building EXPLODES—a massive fireball. He doesn't look back.

The stray cat trots beside him.

EXT. MARINA - DAY

The man with DUFFEL BAGS and the cat boards a sleek YACHT. 

AERIAL VIEW: The yacht pulls away, disappearing into vast blue water.

SMASH CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: "TWENTY YEARS LATER - BROOKLYN, NY"

EXT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - RAINING

Pre-war building in Flatbush-Ditmas Park. Rain pours.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Colorful, lively decor on a budget. Plants, posters, string lights.

MAYA SANTOS (late 20s, Filipina-American, sharp eyes, quiet intensity) stands before her BATHROOM MIRROR. She adjusts her hair, studies her reflection.

A moment of stillness before the storm.

She grabs her PURSE and JACKET, checks her phone.

MAYA
(to herself)
You got this.

She doesn't sound convinced.

EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Maya RUNS through rain to a waiting CAB.

INT. CAB - NIGHT

Maya slides in, soaked.

CABBIE (O.S.)
Maya Santos?

MAYA
(checking phone)
Yes. Hey—the price just jumped!

CABBIE
Surge pricing. It's raining.

Maya applies lipstick, using her phone as a mirror.

EXT./INT. CAB - MANHATTAN BRIDGE - NIGHT

The cab crosses into Manhattan. WHAM—the front tire HITS A POTHOLE.

Maya's hand jerks. Lipstick smears across her cheek.

MAYA
Fuck!

She stares at the mess in her phone camera.

EXT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Maya exits the cab, immediately STEPPING into a deep PUDDLE.

MAYA
Shit!

She looks down at her soaked shoe, shakes her head. Then notices—

A HOMELESS PERSON huddled under a cardboard box nearby.

Maya hesitates, torn. Then kneels down, pulls crumpled BILLS from her purse.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(gently)
Here. Get some coffee. Warm up at the
shop on the corner, okay?

The person looks up, grateful. Nods.

Maya stands, water dripping from her hair, and heads inside.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

DARK, CRAMPED HALLWAY. Maya hurries toward the stage, glimpsing SHADY FIGURES in a BACK OFFICE through a partially open door.

No time to process—the EMCEE calls her name.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Small, intimate. Maybe 40 people. Exposed brick, dim lighting.

EMCEE (30s, enthusiastic)
Give it up for Maya Santos!

SCATTERED APPLAUSE. Maya walks to center stage and—

Sits down in a CHAIR.

Beat. Confused looks from the audience.

MAYA
(timidly)
How's everyone doing tonight?

RANDOM HECKLER 1 (O.S.)
Why are you sitting down?!

MAYA
Get ready folks, because tonight I'm your Comedy Ass—

RANDOM HECKLER 2 (O.S.)
The emcee already said that! What does that even mean?

RANDOM HECKLER 1 (O.S.)
Yeah! Be funny!

MAYA
(flustered)
Okay, so... has anyone here ever...

She trails off. Loses her train of thought.

QUICK MONTAGE: Maya tells joke after joke. The audience stares blankly. A few people check their phones. Someone yawns.

Finally: Maya stares at the audience. The audience stares back. 

Silence.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Thanks, everyone.

She stands, exits. Weak, obligatory applause.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - UPSTAIRS LOUNGE - NIGHT

Maya climbs stairs to a dim lounge. TV SCREENS above the bar show different comedy sets and a BASKETBALL GAME.

At a corner table: FRED (50s, grizzled), MIRIAM (30s, queer, sharp), and ETHAN (early 20s, Gen Z energy).

ETHAN
Oof.

MIRIAM
Bad set, huh?

MAYA
You heard?

FRED
(gestures to TV screens)
We could see it on the monitors. Even without sound, we could tell you were drowning.

MIRIAM
So tell me again—why the sitting down?

MAYA
I thought it'd be different. Memorable.

FRED
You're overthinking it, kid. Just be
funny.

ETHAN
Remember that guy Bob who called himself "Bob the Unfunny Comic"?

MIRIAM
He wasn't funny.

ETHAN
That was his point though.

Maya's phone BUZZES. She checks it—"AGENT."

MAYA
I need to take this.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - MAIN ROOM - EMPTY - NIGHT

Maya descends to the empty showroom, answers.

MAYA
So you heard?

AGENT (V.O.)
(blunt)
Perhaps comedy isn't the path for you.

MAYA
Tonight didn't go as planned, but I'm not throwing in the towel. With all this rain, I'm gonna need it.

She laughs at her own joke. Silence from the agent.

AGENT (V.O.)
Think about what I said.

The call ends. Maya stands alone in the empty room.

FLASHBACK - INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Teenage MAYA (17) sits in the back. A stern TEACHER drones on about Shakespeare.

TEACHER
To be or not to be, that is the—

TEEN MAYA
(timing it perfectly)
...question my parents ask when I bring home a B-plus.

The class ERUPTS in laughter. Even the teacher cracks a smile.

In a middle row, TEEN LARA (17, already tech-savvy with chunky glasses) laughs along with everyone else. She watches Maya with quiet admiration—the girl who can make the whole room light up.

Maya doesn't notice her. She's soaking in the moment, the power of making people laugh.

BACK TO PRESENT - INT. COMEDY CLUB - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Maya smiles at the memory. Then her expression changes—

Through the walls: MUFFLED VOICES from the back office.

Then: BANG.

A gunshot.

Maya freezes. Her heart pounds.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Maya inches down the hallway. Looks toward the back office.

Through the cracked door: A MAN slumped in a chair. Blood. Another man standing over him—HENCHMAN 1 (40s, brutal).

Their eyes meet.

HENCHMAN 1
Hey!

Maya BOLTS.

EXT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Maya CHARGES into the TORRENTIAL RAIN, SPRINTING across the street like an Olympian.

Henchman 1 follows, slower but steady.

Maya ducks behind BOXES, catching her breath. Rain pounds.

Suddenly—a cold, wet DOG'S NOSE against her cheek.

She turns to see a soaking wet BORDER COLLIE excitedly NUDGING her face.

MAYA
(whispering)
Shhh! Quiet, boy!

She pets him. The dog wags, unconcerned.

Henchman 1 reaches the street, looks around. Can't see Maya. He heads back inside.

The dog TAKES OFF down the street. Stops at a PET STORE, JUMPING and PAWING at the door.

Maya follows.

EXT. PET STORE - NIGHT

Maya catches up. Reads the sign: "PET HAVEN."

She KNOCKS. Looks through the window.

MAYA
(to the dog)
Is this your home?

INT. PET STORE - NIGHT

A LIGHT flicks on. LARA (early 30s, natural beauty, tech genius energy) comes to the door in pajamas. Opens it.

LARA
Bosco! How did you—

She sees Maya, drenched and terrified.

MAYA
Does he live here? Can we come in? We're soaked and I—someone's after me.

LARA
Come in, come in.

Maya and Bosco rush inside. Lara locks the door.

LARA (CONT'D)
Let me get towels.

She returns with two towels. Hands one to Maya. Uses the other on Bosco, who JUMPS onto the counter.

MAYA
Thanks. I'm Maya. Maya Santos.

LARA
I'm Lara. And this troublemaker is Bosco.

Recognition flickers across Maya's face.

MAYA
Wait... Lara? Lara Chen? From Franklin High?

LARA
(squinting)
Maya?! Oh my god, Maya Santos?

MAYA
Holy shit, I haven't seen you since—

BANG BANG BANG. A FIST pounds on the WINDOW.

A LARGE FIGURE peers through. Henchman 1.

BOSCO
(ferocious barking)

MAYA
(frantically)
I witnessed something at the club—a murder! They're after me! Please, can you help me disappear?

Lara's expression shifts. From surprise to calculation.

LARA
Hurry. This way.

Maya follows Lara toward the back of the shop, down a NARROW HALLWAY.

Lara pushes aside STACKED BOXES, revealing a SMALL ELEVATOR hidden in the wall.

They step inside. Doors close.

The pounding continues above.

INT. LARA'S BASEMENT LAB - NIGHT

The ELEVATOR DESCENDS. Doors open to reveal—

A SECRET HACKER'S PARADISE. WALL OF MONITORS behind a desk covered in papers. High-tech equipment. Weapons on the wall. Maps. Surveillance photos.

Maya's jaw drops.

MAYA
What is this?

Bosco enters through a DOGGIE DOOR, shakes off water.

LARA
I've suspected criminal activity at that club for months. I haven't been able to collect solid evidence.

She taps a keyboard. Monitors light up with SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE—the comedy club's back office. Shady deals. Money exchanging hands.

LARA (CONT'D)
Perhaps you can help me with that.

MAYA
Help you? I'm a comedian! I tell jokes about airline food and dating apps!

LARA
You were also the smartest person in our class. Quick thinker. Brave.

MAYA
That was high school debate club, not actual crime fighting!

LARA
(turns to face her)
Those men are part of a larger network. They hurt people, Maya. They traffic drugs, launder money, blackmail. And no one stops them because they've infiltrated law enforcement.

Beat. Maya processes this.

MAYA
So what are you? Some kind of vigilante?

LARA
I'm someone who got tired of waiting for justice.

She pulls up more files. Faces. Names. Crimes.

LARA (CONT'D)
I can teach you to fight. To defend yourself. To help me take them down from the inside. You've already seen too much—they won't stop looking for you.

Maya stares at the monitors. The homeless person she helped earlier flashes through her mind.

MAYA
How many people are they hurting?

LARA
Too many.

Long beat. Maya makes her decision.

MAYA
Okay. Teach me.

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

TITLE CARD: "FIVE YEARS LATER"

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

A vibrant, packed comedy club. Brick walls covered with posters of comedy legends. The atmosphere crackles with energy.

SPLIT SCREEN MONTAGE set to driving electronic music:

LEFT SIDE - MAYA'S COMEDY EVOLUTION:

- Maya bombing at open mics, pushing through
- Finding her voice, getting laughs
- Better time slots, bigger crowds
- Confident stage presence

RIGHT SIDE - MAYA'S COMBAT TRAINING:

- Lara teaching hand-to-hand combat in the basement
- Weapons training—guns, knives, improvised tools
- Parkour across Brooklyn rooftops at dawn
- Synchronized sparring, moving like partners

The two sides MERGE into one as we—

RETURN TO PRESENT:

ON STAGE: FRED grips the mic, deadpan delivery.

FRED
These Gen Z kids, man. One told me the last time he used email was in high school. When I was in high school, there was no such thing as email. Hell, my fridge is so smart now it started judging me. Opened it last night and it said, "Really, Fred? Another beer? There's kale right here."

The crowd ROARS.

ETHAN takes the stage next, smooth and energetic.

ETHAN
Every time I tell someone I'm a comedian, they're like, "What's your real job?"  This IS it! My job is making jokes about how my only other skill is making instant ramen in a way that makes people laugh.

Chuckles and nods of recognition.

ETHAN (CONT'D)
(grinning)
That's my time. Now give it up for your comedy assassin—MAYA SANTOS!

The crowd ERUPTS. Maya strides onto stage—confident, radiant, commanding.

MAYA
Thank you, thank you! So I was thinking—if laughter's the best medicine, why aren't doctors just showing you videos of people falling down? It'd be cheaper than my copay!

LAUGHTER. She's in control now.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Seriously though, I had a rough week. My therapist told me I have commitment issues. I was like, "That's not true!" Then I realized I've changed therapists four times this year.

More LAUGHTER. She owns the room.

QUICK MONTAGE: Maya delivers punchline after punchline. The audience eats it up. Close-up on her eyes—sparkling with joy.

She's found her rhythm.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Maya steps off stage, riding the high. APPLAUSE still echoes.

She catches her breath, then checks her watch.

MAYA
(to herself)
Time to switch gears.

She heads down a narrow hallway to what appears to be a UTILITY CLOSET.

INT. UTILITY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

Maya enters, closes the door. Pushes aside mops and cleaning supplies.

Behind them: A HIDDEN PANEL. She presses it—clicks open.

A SMALL ELEVATOR. She steps inside.

INT. SECRET LAIR - BENEATH THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator descends. Doors open to reveal the EXPANDED version of Lara's operation.

Multiple MONITORS display surveillance feeds across NYC. High-tech WEAPONS mounted on walls. Training area. Holographic displays. A VESPA SCOOTER parked near a reinforced exit.

Pure Batman '66 retro-futurism meets modern tech.

Lara sits at the main console, fingers flying across keyboards. She doesn't look up.

LARA
Good set?

MAYA
Killed it. What've we got?

Maya joins her, pulling her hair back. Switches from comedian to operative seamlessly.

LARA
Three potential targets. All connected to that shipping company we flagged last month.

She pulls up DOSSIERS. Faces, names, crimes.

LARA (CONT'D)
This one's hosting a party tomorrow night. Penthouse in Tribeca. Could be our chance to plant surveillance.

MAYA
Access?

LARA
Caterers. I can get you in as waitstaff.

MAYA
Perfect. What about backup?

LARA
I'll be in your ear the whole time.

Maya studies the target's face on screen.

MAYA
We've taken down what, fourteen operations now?

LARA
Fifteen if you count the warehouse in Red Hook.

MAYA
And yet it feels like there's always more.

LARA
Because there is. But we're making a difference, Maya.

Beat. Maya nods.

MAYA
Yeah. We are.

Bosco trots over, nuzzles Maya's leg. She scratches his ears.

EXT. TRIBECA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Sleek high-rise. LIMOUSINES drop off WEALTHY GUESTS in designer clothes.

INT. TRIBECA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Opulent party. Chandeliers, champagne, jazz trio.

Maya moves through the crowd in a CATERING UNIFORM, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres. She's invisible—just another server.

LARA (V.O.)
(through earpiece)
Target's on the balcony, east side.

Maya nods subtly, navigates through guests.

She passes DMITRI VOLKOV (40s, Russian oligarch, dangerous smile).

DMITRI
(to his associate)
...the shipment arrives Tuesday. Make sure customs doesn't ask questions.

Maya slows slightly, listening.

LARA (V.O.)
Got it. Keep moving.

Maya continues toward the balcony, sets her tray on a table. Slips a TINY LISTENING DEVICE under the railing.

A HAND grabs her wrist.

She turns—SECURITY GUARD, suspicious.

SECURITY GUARD
You're not with the regular catering company.

MAYA
(thick accent)
I am new. My English, not so good. Sorry!

She pulls away, but he doesn't let go.

SECURITY GUARD
Come with me.

LARA (V.O.)
Maya—

MAYA
(dropping the accent)
Or what? You'll bore me to death with your security guard stories?

She TWISTS his wrist, BREAKS his grip, DRIVES her palm into his nose.

He stumbles back. Other guests notice.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Shit.

She RUNS.

INT. PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Maya sprints down a hallway. Two more GUARDS emerge.

She SLIDES between them, KICKS one in the knee, ELBOWS the other in the throat.

Reaches a WINDOW. Looks out—fire escape.

LARA (V.O.)
Maya, you have four more coming from the west corridor!

MAYA
Copy that!

She KICKS the window open, climbs onto—

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Maya descends rapidly, taking stairs three at a time. 

Above: GUARDS pile onto the fire escape.

Below: A GUARD exits onto the street level platform, blocking her path.

Maya doesn't hesitate—LEAPS over the railing, DROPS onto a dumpster below, ROLLS to the ground.

Lands in a crouch. Looks up at the stunned guards.

MAYA
(saluting)
Thanks for having me!

She RUNS into the night.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER

Maya and Lara watch the surveillance footage replay on monitors.

LARA
Well, we got the intel. And you got Made in under ten minutes.

MAYA
(defensive)
The guard was weirdly observant!

LARA
Next time, I'm going in.

MAYA
What?

LARA
You heard me. I'm tired of being mission control. I can fight too, rememmber I taught you!

MAYA
That's exactly why you can't go! You're too valuable here. You're the brains!

LARA
And you're the muscle? Don't patronize me, Maya.

Tension. Bosco whines, sensing the conflict.

MAYA
I'm not—Lara, I couldn't do this without you. I need you here. Safe.

LARA
I don't need you to protect me. We're supposed to be partners.

Beat. Maya softens.

MAYA
You're right. I'm sorry. Next time... we'll figure out a way for you to be in the field.

LARA
Promise?

MAYA
Promise.

They bump fists. The tension eases.

LARA
So what did we get from Volkov's conversation?

Maya pulls up the audio file. They listen.

DMITRI (RECORDING)
...the shipment arrives Tuesday. The boss wants it moved immediately. No trails. Johnson's orders.

Both women freeze.

MAYA
Johnson?

LARA
That name keeps coming up. We need to find out who he is.

She types rapidly. Files populate the screen.

LARA (CONT'D)
Cross-referencing every mention of "Johnson" in our surveillance over the past six months...

Dozens of CONNECTIONS appear—a web linking multiple targets.

MAYA
Holy shit. He's connected to everyone we've been tracking.

LARA
Not just connected. He's the center. Look.

She highlights the network. Every criminal operation feeds back to one name: MR. JOHNSON.

LARA (CONT'D)
He's been invisible this whole time. Running everything from the shadows.

MAYA
So we find him. Take him down.

LARA
There's more. Look at this.

She pulls up REAL ESTATE RECORDS.

LARA (CONT'D)
Johnson's been buying up properties across Brooklyn. Including...

The screen shows: THE COMEDY BASEMENT building.

MAYA
What? No. He can't—

LARA
He's already started demolition permits. If we don't stop him, this place is gone in two weeks.

Maya stares at the screen. The club—her home, her friends, her cover—all at risk.

MAYA
Then we stop him. How?

LARA
He's hosting a gala. Tomorrow night. Black tie, high society, the works. If we can get in, gather evidence, we might be able to—

MAYA
I'll go.

LARA
Maya—

MAYA
This is personal now. He wants to take everything. So we take him down first.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Maya runs through her set notes. Fred approaches.

FRED
You okay, kid? You seem distracted.

MAYA
Yeah, just... thinking about the future.

FRED
The future? You're young. The future's whatever you make it.

MAYA
What if someone's trying to take it away from you?

FRED
(considers)
Then you fight for it. But you don't fight alone. That's what this place is— family.

He squeezes her shoulder and walks away.

Miriam appears, arms crossed.

MIRIAM
Okay, spill. Where do you disappear to after shows?

MAYA
What? I don't—

MIRIAM
Maya, I've known you for five years. I see you leave through the back, and you don't come out the front. So either you're a vampire, or something's up.

MAYA
(laughs it off)
Maybe I am a vampire. Ever see me in daylight?

MIRIAM
I'm serious. Are you in trouble?

Maya meets her eyes. Wants to tell her. Can't.

MAYA
I'm fine. I promise.

Miriam doesn't look convinced, but she nods.

MIRIAM
If you need help—with anything—I'm here. Okay?

MAYA
Thanks, Mir.

INT. SECRET LAIR - NIGHT

Maya and Lara prepare for the gala.

LARA
Your cover: Maya Delgado, socialite from Miami. New money, tech industry. Curious about investments.

MAYA
Got it. And my extraction?

LARA
Fire exit, east stairwell. I'll have a car waiting on 57th Street.

Lara pulls out an ELEGANT BLACK DRESS and JEWELRY.

LARA (CONT'D)
The necklace has a camera. The earrings are comms. And this—

She shows Maya a sleek CLUTCH PURSE.

LARA (CONT'D)
Taser, lockpicks, and a smoke grenade. Just in case.

MAYA
(trying on the dress)
How do I look?

LARA
Like someone who costs a thousand dollars an hour.

MAYA
(laughs)
That's either a compliment or an insult, I can't tell.

LARA
(smiling)
Compliment. You look amazing.

Their eyes meet. A moment of warmth.

MAYA
Lara... thank you. For everything.

LARA
We're in this together. Always.

EXT. MANHATTAN HOTEL - NIGHT

A LUXURY HOTEL on Park Avenue. Limos arrive. PAPARAZZI snap photos of wealthy GUESTS.

Maya steps out of a town car in her gown, poised and elegant.

She hands her invitation to security.

SECURITY
Ms. Delgado. Welcome.

She enters.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

LAVISH. Crystal chandeliers, live orchestra, ice sculptures.

Maya accepts a champagne flute, blends into the crowd.

LARA (V.O.)
You're in. Johnson's in the VIP lounge, second floor. I need you to get eyes on him.

MAYA
(quietly)
Copy.

She mingles, laughing at appropriate times, making small talk.

A WAITER passes with appetizers.

WAITER
Foie gras?

MAYA
(cheerfully)
I'm more of a street cart hot dog girl, but sure!

The waiter looks confused. Maya takes one, moves on.

She ascends a GRAND STAIRCASE toward the VIP lounge.

INT. VIP LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Smaller, more intimate. Leather chairs, cigars, quieter conversations.

And there he is: MR. JOHNSON (50s, silver hair, expensive suit, dangerous charisma). He laughs with a group of men, completely at ease.

Maya's breath catches. She snaps photos with her necklace camera.

LARA (V.O.)
That's him. Good work. Now—

MR. JOHNSO
(turning, locking eyes with
Maya)
I don't believe we've met.

He crosses to her, hand extended. Warm smile.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Thaddeus Johnson. And you are?

MAYA
(smooth)
Maya Delgado. Pleasure.

They shake hands. His grip lingers a moment too long.

MR. JOHNSON
Delgado... Miami tech scene, if I'm not
mistaken?

MAYA
You've done your homework.

MR. JOHNSON
I make it a point to know everyone in
the room. Especially someone as
captivating as you.

He gestures to a PRIVATE SEATING AREA. They sit.

LARA (V.O.)
(warning)
Be careful. He's too smooth.

MR. JOHNSON
So, Maya, what brings you to New York?

MAYA
Opportunity. I hear there's plenty of it
here.

MR. JOHNSON
Indeed. Though opportunities often come
with... complications.

MAYA
I can handle complications.

MR. JOHNSON
(leaning in)
Can you? You strike me as someone used
to being in control. The one calling the
shots.

MAYA
Is that a problem?

MR. JOHNSON
On the contrary. I admire it. In fact,
you remind me of someone. Someone who
used to be very good at what they did.

Beat. The air shifts.

MAYA
Oh? Who's that?

MR. JOHNSON
A comedian. Performs at a little club in
Brooklyn. The Comedy Basement. Ever
heard of it?

Maya's blood runs cold. She keeps her expression neutral.

MAYA
Can't say I have.

MR. JOHNSON
Pity. It's closing soon. Development, you
know. The neighborhood's changing.

MAYA
That's a shame. I hear comedy clubs have
character.

MR. JOHNSON
Character doesn't pay the bills, Ms.
Delgado. Or should I say... Ms. Santos?

Maya's hand moves toward her clutch.

MAYA
I don't know what you—

MR. JOHNSON
Please. Don't insult my intelligence. Or
yours. Maya Santos, the Comedy Assassin.
Quite the act you've been running.

Shit. She's blown.

LARA (V.O.)
(urgent)
Maya, get out. Now.

MR. JOHNSON
(gesturing subtly)
My men have exits covered. And your
little hacker friend? We've been
tracking your communications for weeks.

Two GUARDS appear, flanking Maya.

MAYA
So what now? You kill me?

MR. JOHNSON
Kill you? Goodness, no. I'd like to hire
you.

Beat. Maya wasn't expecting that.

MAYA
Excuse me?

MR. JOHNSON
You're talented. Resourceful. You've
dismantled fifteen of my operations. I
respect that. It takes skill.

MAYA
I'm not interested.

MR. JOHNSON
Not even to save your friends? Fred,
Miriam, Ethan? I have files on all of
them. One word from me, and their lives
become very uncomfortable.

Rage flashes across Maya's face.

MAYA
You're threatening them?

MR. JOHNSON
I'm offering you a choice. Work for me,
and they stay safe. Refuse, and, well...
accidents happen.

LARA (V.O.)
Don't listen to him!

MAYA
(standing)
I'd rather burn your whole operation to
the ground.

MR. JOHNSON
(sighs)
I was afraid you'd say that.

He nods. The guards move.

MAYA
(into her earpiece)
Lara, little help?

LARA (V.O.)
On it!

The LIGHTS suddenly CUT OUT.

Emergency lights kick in—flashing red.

Maya KICKS the table at the guards, BOLTS for the stairs.

INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

CHAOS. Guests scream, confused.

Maya weaves through the panicked crowd.

Behind her: Guards push through, closing in.

The ORCHESTRA is still playing—but now it's "Electric Slide."

The crowd, despite the confusion, begins to DANCE. It's instinct. The song's irresistible.

Even the guards slow down, their bodies moving to the rhythm.

MAYA
(grinning)
Oh, hell no—I gotta do this.

She SLIDES LEFT, steps right, falls into formation with the crowd.

The guards, unable to resist, JOIN IN. They're all doing the Electric Slide together.

GUARD #1
(confused, still dancing)
What... are we doing?

MAYA
(executing a perfect cha-cha)
Living your best life! Hope you
stretched!

The song hits its climax. Maya spins, uses the final beat to BREAK from formation.

She gathers her gown and RUNS—heels clicking across marble.

HURDLES over a knocked-over chair, spins past a bewildered couple, and spots an OPEN WINDOW leading to the fire escape.

She climbs through.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Maya lands gracefully despite the constraining gown. The fabric sparkles under moonlight.

She catches her breath, grinning.

MAYA
(to herself)
Best. Escape. Ever.

She descends the fire escape, reaching street level.

A CAR pulls up—Lara at the wheel.

LARA
Get in!

Maya jumps in. They SPEED OFF.

INT. LARA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Maya kicks off her heels, breathless.

MAYA
He knows who I am. He knows about you,
the club, everything.

LARA
(focused on driving)
I know. I intercepted some of his
communications while you were inside. He
has surveillance on us.

MAYA
How long?

LARA
At least three months.

MAYA
Fuck. So what do we do?

LARA
We go dark. Relocate operations. Hit him
before he hits us.

Maya nods, adrenaline still pumping.

MAYA
He threatened Fred, Miriam, Ethan. If we
don't stop him—

LARA
We will. But we need to be smart about
it.

EXT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

Not the lair under the club. A different location—an INDUSTRIAL BUILDING in Red Hook.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

Sparse. Temporary. Lara sets up equipment while Maya paces.

MAYA
We can't keep running. We need to end
this.

LARA
Agreed. But we need leverage. Something
that puts him away for good.

She pulls up files on her laptop.

LARA (CONT'D)
I've been digging into his network. He's
planning something big. A shipment
coming through the port tomorrow night.

MAYA
What kind of shipment?

LARA
Human trafficking. Girls from Eastern
Europe. He's been running this operation
for years.

Maya's face hardens.

MAYA
Then we stop it. We get proof, call the
real cops, and end him.

LARA
It's risky. His security will be tight.

MAYA
I don't care. This ends tomorrow.

Beat. Lara studies her.

LARA
Maya... are you sure you're ready for
this? This isn't just taking down some
money laundering operation. If we go
after him directly—

MAYA
I'm sure. Those girls deserve better. 
Everyone he's hurt deserves justice.

LARA
(softly)
Okay. Then let's plan.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Lara and Maya sit across from each other, exhausted. A MAP of the port spread between them.

LARA
Here's the warehouse. Two entrances—main
dock and service bay.

MAYA
Guard rotation?

LARA
Every twenty minutes. Four men per team.

MAYA
We go in during rotation change. Fifteen-
second window.

LARA
I'll handle surveillance from here. Guide
you through.

MAYA
No. You're coming with me.

LARA
What?

MAYA
You said you wanted to be in the field.
This is your chance. I need backup, and
I trust you more than anyone.

Lara's eyes widen.

LARA
Maya, I... are you sure?

MAYA
We're partners. It's time we acted like
it.

Lara breaks into a smile.

LARA
Okay. Let's do this together.

They clasp hands across the table.

MONTAGE: PREPARATION

- Maya and Lara gear up: tactical suits, weapons, comms
- Lara programs drones for aerial surveillance
- Maya practices hand-to-hand combinations
- Both syncing their movements, planning every step
- Bosco watches, tail wagging

INT. SAFEHOUSE - TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT

Maya and Lara spar, both exhausted. Their movements are sloppy now.

LARA
(breathing hard)
Remember when we used to study for finals
together?

MAYA
(blocks a punch)
Yeah. Feels like a lifetime ago.

LARA
You always knew you'd do something big.
Make a difference.

MAYA
(lands a hit)
So did you. Look at us now.

They break apart, both grinning despite the exhaustion.

LARA
Who knew it'd involve this much punching?

MAYA
(laughs)
Right? My high school career counselor
did not prepare me for this.

They laugh together. Then Lara's expression shifts.

LARA
Maya... if something goes wrong
tomorrow—

MAYA
Nothing's going wrong.

LARA
But if it does. I need you to know—you're
the best friend I've ever had.

Maya pulls her into a hug.

MAYA
Same. And that's why we're both walking
out of there tomorrow. Deal?

LARA
Deal.

They separate. Ready.

EXT. RED HOOK - CRUMBLING WAREHOUSE TURNED NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Maya's VESPA SCOOTER pulls up outside a FOREBODING WAREHOUSE. Its crumbling brick facade casts eerie shadows. NEON SIGNS flicker: "PULSE" - a makeshift nightclub.

BASS THUMPS from inside. A LINE of people wait to get in.

Maya parks, pulls off her helmet. She's in civilian clothes—jeans, leather jacket.

LARA (V.O.)
(through earpiece)
You sure about this? Going in alone?

MAYA
You're tracking everything, right?

LARA (V.O.)
Every camera, every exit. But Maya, his
security will be heavy in there.

MAYA
Then I'll blend in. Just another club
kid looking to dance.

She joins the line.

INT. WAREHOUSE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

CHAOS. FLASHING LIGHTS, PULSATING MUSIC, THRONGS OF PEOPLE DANCING. The space is massive—exposed beams, industrial aesthetic, but transformed into a den of vice.

Maya enters, letting her eyes adjust. The crowd is thick, the energy electric.

She moves through the sea of bodies, scanning.

LARA (V.O.)
He's in the VIP section, back left. Be
careful.

Maya spots it: A RAISED PLATFORM with velvet ropes. BOUNCERS guarding it. Through the crowd she can see FIGURES inside—including JOHNSON.

She approaches the VIP entrance.

BOUNCER
(blocking her)
Private section.

MAYA
(flirting)
Come on. I'm friends with Thad.

BOUNCER
Who?

MAYA
Mr. Johnson. Tell him Maya's here.

The bouncer speaks into his radio. After a moment, he unhooks the rope.

BOUNCER
He says you can go up.

Maya climbs the stairs to the VIP platform.

INT. WAREHOUSE NIGHTCLUB - VIP SECTION - CONTINUOUS

Quieter up here, but the bass still THRUMS. Leather couches, bottle service, JOHNSON'S CREW lounging.

And there he is: MR. JOHNSON, leaning back with a drink, completely at ease.

MR. JOHNSON
(smiling)
Maya Santos. I was wondering when you'd
show up.

MAYA
You knew I'd come?

MR. JOHNSON
Of course. You're predictable. Noble.
You can't resist trying to save the day.

He gestures to a seat. Maya sits, staying alert.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Can I offer you a drink?

MAYA
I'm not here to socialize.

MR. JOHNSON
No? Then why are you here?

MAYA
To stop you. The shipment. The
trafficking. All of it.

MR. JOHNSON
(laughs)
And how exactly do you plan to do that?
You're one woman in a room full of my
men.

MAYA
I'm not alone.

LARA (V.O.)
(in her ear)
Maya, I'm reading twelve hostiles in
your immediate vicinity. This isn't
good.

MR. JOHNSON
Your hacker friend? Please. I've been
jamming her signals since you walked in.

Maya's blood runs cold. She touches her earpiece—STATIC.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
You see, Maya, this isn't just a
nightclub. It's a fortress. My fortress.

He stands, walks to the railing overlooking the dance floor.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
All these people down there? They have
no idea what's happening above them. The
deals, the shipments, the power. They
just want to dance and forget their
problems.

MAYA
Is that what you tell yourself? That
you're giving them an escape?

MR. JOHNSON
I'm giving them what they want. Just
like I'm giving you what you want.

MAYA
Which is?

MR. JOHNSON
A villain to fight. A purpose. Without
me, what are you? Just another failed
comedian.

Maya stands, anger flashing.

MAYA
You don't know anything about me.

MR. JOHNSON
Don't I? You witnessed a murder five
years ago and instead of going to the
police, you became a vigilante. Why?
Because you needed to matter. To be
special.

MAYA
I did it to help people you hurt.

MR. JOHNSON
And I appreciate that. Truly. It's made
you quite formidable. Which is why I'm
offering you one last chance: join me,
or die here.

His men stand, hands moving to weapons.

MAYA
I'd rather die fighting you than live
serving you.

MR. JOHNSON
(sighs)
I was afraid you'd say that.

He nods. His men move in.

Suddenly—the MUSIC CUTS OUT. The lights shift to emergency mode.

LARA (V.O.)
(breaking through static)
Miss me?

The DANCE FLOOR erupts in confusion as the MAIN LIGHTS CUT, leaving only STROBING EMERGENCY LIGHTS.

Maya doesn't hesitate—she KICKS the coffee table at the nearest guard, VAULTS over the VIP railing, and DROPS into the crowd below.

INT. WAREHOUSE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Maya hits the dance floor, blending into the panicked crowd.

Johnson's men pursue from above, pushing through dancers.

LARA (V.O.)
East exit, thirty meters. Bosco's
waiting.

Maya fights her way through the crowd. A GUARD grabs her—she SPINS, STRIKES his throat, keeps moving.

Another GUARD blocks her path. She uses a DANCER as a pivot point, SWINGING around and KICKING him in the chest.

The crowd is chaos now—people screaming, pushing toward exits.

Maya spots the EAST EXIT. Sprints for it.

But THREE GUARDS block the door.

She skids to a halt.

Behind her: MORE GUARDS closing in.

She's trapped.

Then: CRASH! A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS above.

LARA descends on a rope, tactical gear, holding TWO SMOKE GRENADES.

She THROWS them. SMOKE FILLS the nightclub.

LARA
(landing beside Maya)
Told you I wanted in the field!

MAYA
(grinning)
Best entrance ever!

They fight BACK-TO-BACK through the smoke.

Lara takes down guards with precision strikes. Maya uses the environment—bottles, chairs, the bar itself.

They reach the exit together.

EXT. WAREHOUSE NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

They burst outside. BOSCO waits, barking excitedly.

Behind them: JOHNSON and his remaining men emerge.

MR. JOHNSON
You can run, but I'll always find you!

MAYA
We're not running!

She turns, pulls out her PHONE, and hits a button.

Suddenly: SIRENS. POLICE LIGHTS flooding the area.

Not just local police—FBI VEHICLES. FEDERAL AGENTS swarm the warehouse.

FBI AGENT
(through bullhorn)
This is the FBI! Everyone on the ground!

Johnson's face goes from rage to shock to fear.

His men scatter. Some surrender immediately.

Johnson stands frozen as AGENTS surround him.

FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
Thaddeus Johnson, you're under arrest.

Maya and Lara watch from across the street as Johnson is CUFFED and led away.

He locks eyes with Maya one final time.

MR. JOHNSON
This isn't over.

MAYA
Yeah. It is.

He's pushed into a federal vehicle and driven away.

Maya and Lara stand together, exhausted, victorious.

LARA
We did it.

MAYA
WE did it. Nice entrance, by the way.

LARA
Learned from the best.

They bump fists. Bosco jumps on both of them.

The warehouse nightclub behind them is swarming with federal agents. It's over.

MAYA
(defiant)
You're finished, Johnson. We have all
the proof we need.

MR. JOHNSON
Proof? Oh, Maya. You still don't
understand. I own the police. The
judges. The prosecutors. Your "proof"
means nothing.

He walks closer.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
This isn't about evidence. It's about
power. And I have all of it.

MAYA
Not all of it.

She presses a button on her wrist device.

Suddenly: SIRENS. FLASHING LIGHTS outside.

FBI AGENTS storm the warehouse from all sides.

FBI AGENT
FBI! Nobody move!

Johnson's face twists in rage and confusion.

MR. JOHNSON
What did you—

LARA
(smiling)
We didn't go to your cops. We went
federal. Turns out they've been
investigating you for years. We just
gave them the missing pieces.

FBI agents swarm, weapons drawn.

FBI AGENT
Thaddeus Johnson, you're under arrest
for human trafficking, money laundering,
and about twenty other charges.

Johnson's men don't fight. They drop their weapons.

Johnson stares at Maya, his composure cracking.

MR. JOHNSON
You think this changes anything? I'll be
out in a week. I have lawyers—

MAYA
(stepping close)
And we have everything. Bank records.
Names. Locations. Every single crime.
You're done.

FBI agents CUFF Johnson and lead him away.

He locks eyes with Maya one last time.

MR. JOHNSON
This isn't over.

MAYA
Yeah. It is.

He's dragged out. The warehouse empties.

Maya and Lara stand alone, breathing hard.

LARA
We did it.

MAYA
We actually did it.

They look at each other and LAUGH—relief, exhaustion, joy.

Bosco runs over, tail wagging. They both pet him.

LARA
Come on. Let's go home.

EXT. BROOKLYN - DAWN

The sun rises over the city. News helicopters circle the port.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Maya sleeps in her bed, finally at peace.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

WEEKS LATER.

The club is PACKED. Renovations have been made—fresh paint, new lighting.

Maya takes the stage to THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

MAYA
Thank you! It's great to be back. You
know, I had an interesting few weeks.
Can't really talk about it—legal reasons
—but let's just say I've been working on
my "direct approach" to problem-solving.

LAUGHTER.

MAYA (CONT'D)
They say comedy's all about timing. Same
with... other activities. Like, I don't
know, stopping bad guys? Hypothetically.

More LAUGHTER. The audience loves her.

MAYA (CONT'D)
But seriously, I'm grateful to be here.
This place—it's home. And you don't let
anyone take your home without a fight.

APPLAUSE. She sees her friends in the crowd—Fred, Miriam, Ethan—all smiling.

MAYA (CONT'D)
So thank you for being here. For
laughing. For reminding me why I do
this. You're the best.

She delivers the rest of her set flawlessly. She's never been better.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - BACKSTAGE - LATER

Maya comes off stage. Miriam's waiting.

MIRIAM
That was amazing. You've really found
your voice.

MAYA
Thanks, Mir.

MIRIAM
So... can we talk? About where you
really go at night?

Maya considers. Then nods.

MAYA
Yeah. Let's talk.

They head to a quiet corner.

INT. SECRET LAIR - NIGHT

Maya and Lara sit at the console. Bosco sleeps nearby.

LARA
All of Johnson's assets have been seized.
The victims from the trafficking ring
are being helped. His network is
dismantled.

MAYA
And the club?

LARA
Saved. I bought the building. Turns out
I had some money saved up.

MAYA
(grinning)
Some money? Lara, you bought a building.

LARA
(shrugs)
Smart investments. Plus, now we have a
permanent base. Can't complain.

They clink beer bottles.

MAYA
So what's next?

LARA
I don't know. Rest? Actually sleep?

MAYA
(laughs)
That sounds nice.

Beat. Comfortable silence.

LARA
Maya... there's something I need to tell
you.

Her expression shifts. Serious.

MAYA
What's wrong?

Lara pulls out a THICK FOLDER. Places it on the desk. Her hands shake slightly.

LARA
I've been digging deeper into Johnson's
history. Following connections. And I
found something.

She opens the folder. DOCUMENTS, PHOTOS, HANDWRITTEN NOTES.

LARA (CONT'D)
This goes back twenty years. To a man
who worked at a corporate office.

She shows Maya a PHOTO: The man from the opening sequence.

LARA (CONT'D)
His wife and child disappeared. He
killed his boss, stole money, and
vanished.

MAYA
Okay...?

LARA
That man changed his identity. Started
over. Built a criminal empire.

She shows another PHOTO: a younger Mr. Johnson. It's the same man.

MAYA
Jesus. So Johnson's been doing this for
decades.

LARA
There's more.

She pulls out a BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Her voice cracks.

LARA (CONT'D)
His wife... her name was Susan Chen.

Maya's eyes widen.

MAYA
Chen. Like...

LARA
My mother. Maya, I think Thaddeus
Johnson... is my father.

Silence. The weight of the revelation hangs heavy.

MAYA
Lara...

LARA
I never knew him. My mom disappeared
when I was a baby. I was raised by my
aunt. I always thought my dad abandoned
us. But now...

Tears stream down her face.

LARA (CONT'D)
He didn't abandon us. He took us. And
then... I don't know what happened to my
mom. But he became a monster.

Maya moves around the desk, pulls Lara into a hug.

MAYA
I'm so sorry.

LARA
What do I do with this? He's in prison
because of me. My own father.

MAYA
He's in prison because of what he did.
Not because of you.

LARA
But what if there's more to the story?
What if my mom—

MAYA
Then we find out. Together. If you want
answers, we'll get them.

Lara pulls back, wiping her eyes.

LARA
You'd do that?

MAYA
Of course. We're partners. In everything.

Lara nods, steadying herself.

LARA
Okay. Tomorrow. We start digging.

MAYA
Tomorrow. Tonight, we rest.

They sit together in the quiet lair, Bosco between them.

The city hums above. Somewhere, new threats are forming. But for now, they have each other.

FADE TO:

INT. PRISON - VISITATION ROOM - DAY

Mr. Johnson sits across from an UNSEEN VISITOR. He smiles.

MR. JOHNSON
Don't worry. Phase Two begins tomorrow.

VISITOR (O.S.)
And the girl?

MR. JOHNSON
She'll come to me eventually. They
always do.

He leans back, confident.

MR. JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Family is everything, after all.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END

---

POST-CREDITS SCENE:

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Maya performs. The crowd laughs.

MAYA
So I've been thinking about getting a
therapist who specializes in work-life
balance. Think they have someone who
deals with "comedian by night, vigilante
by slightly-earlier-night" issues?

HUGE LAUGH.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Probably not covered by insurance.

She winks at the camera.

FADE OUT.

VISUAL STYLE NOTES:

- Opening: Film noir aesthetic, high contrast
- Present day: Neo-noir meets vibrant color pops
- Comedy clubs: Warm, intimate lighting
- Action sequences: Dynamic, John Wick-inspired
- Secret lair: Retro-futuristic (Batman '66)
- Gala: Opulent, golden tones

FADE OUT.
