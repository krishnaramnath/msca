>_COLD OPEN_<

FADE IN:

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

_Warm stage lights cut through darkness. The electricity of live performance._

A cramped basement comedy club. Exposed brick walls plastered with faded posters. Maybe 30 people scattered across mismatched chairs. The kind of room where dreams go to get heckled.

MAYA SANTOS (late 20s, African-American and Filipina, natural hair in a messy bun, thrift-store bomber jacket) stands in the spotlight. Microphone in hand. She's three minutes into her set.

The crowd is... mixed. Some laughs. Some phones. One guy asleep.

MAYA
(with sharp timing)
So I'm Black and Filipina, which means family gatherings are just... 
(beat)
...confusing. My tita makes the best lumpia, my grandma makes the best collard greens, and I'm in the corner like "Can someone please tell me which oppression to lead with?"

A few genuine laughs. Maya feeds off them.

MAYA (CONT'D)
People ask me "What are you?" Like I'm a Pokémon. "Oh, you got the rare dual-type!" 
(does a Pokémon voice)
"Maya used Survival Instinct! It's super effective!"

More laughs now. She's finding her rhythm.

MAYA (CONT'D)
I moved to Brooklyn thinking I'd finally find my people. You know what I found? A $2,400 studio apartment and a white guy with dreads who told me about "authentic" Filipino food. 
(beat)
Bro, you're from Connecticut.

The room erupts. She's got them now.

But Maya's eyes aren't on the laughing crowd—they're scanning. Reading faces. Body language. Energy shifts. It's instinctive. Protective.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(softer, more honest)
Truth is, I've spent my whole life reading rooms. Figuring out which version of myself keeps me safe. 
(beat)
That's not a joke, by the way. That's just survival.

The laughter fades to something else. Recognition. Connection.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(grinning)
But hey, at least I can make you laugh about it, right?

Applause. Real applause. Maya soaks it in for exactly one second, then—

COMEDY CLUB EMCEE (O.S.)
Maya Santos, everybody! Give it up!

Maya waves, steps off stage. The house lights come up.

>_MAIN TITLES_<

===

>_ACT ONE_<

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

A narrow hallway with peeling paint. Other comics mill around, checking phones, running through bits.

Maya leans against the wall, adrenaline still pumping. She pulls out her phone. Seven texts from her mom. She doesn't open them.

FRED (early 40s, Black, warmth in his eyes despite the world's weight on his shoulders) approaches. He's wearing a vintage bomber jacket and carries himself like someone who's seen things but chooses kindness anyway.

FRED
You killed out there.

MAYA
(modest)
It was okay.

FRED
Maya. I've been doing this twenty years. That wasn't okay. That was real.

Maya allows herself a small smile.

FRED (CONT'D)
You're funny because you're scared. But if you want to be great, you gotta let them see what you're really scared of.

MAYA
(deflecting with humor)
I'm scared of student loans and my mother's disappointment. Pretty sure I covered that.

FRED
You know what I mean.

He's right. She does. She's just not ready to hear it.

FRED (CONT'D)
You going to The Ivory Room next week?

MAYA
(scoffs)
I'm not on that level.

FRED
You are. You're just hiding. 
(beat)
And hiding's not funny.

He pats her shoulder and walks away, leaving Maya alone with that thought.

MAYA
(to herself)
Hiding kept me alive this long...

CUT TO:

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

A tiny studio in Brooklyn. Murphy bed half-folded. Walls covered with comedy show flyers, scribbled joke notes, and one framed photo: Young Maya with her parents, everyone smiling.

Maya sits on her bed, laptop open. Email inbox: 47 unread messages. She scrolls past them all to one:

> **SUBJECT:** Open Mic Spot Available - The Ivory Room

Her cursor hovers over it. Doesn't click.

She closes the laptop. Opens a notebook instead. Pages filled with jokes, crossed-out punchlines, margin notes in different colored pens.

She writes: _"What if I could stop hiding?"_

Stares at it.

Crosses it out.

Writes: _"What if hiding IS the joke?"_

Her phone buzzes. Text from MIRIAM (contact photo: beautiful Latina woman with glasses, mid-laugh):

> **MIRIAM:** "how'd it go tonight babe?"

Maya smiles. Types back:

> **MAYA:** "Killed. Fred said I should do The Ivory Room."

> **MIRIAM:** "OMG DO IT"

> **MAYA:** "I'm not ready"

> **MIRIAM:** "you've been 'not ready' for 3 years"
> **MIRIAM:** "im coming over"

MAYA
(out loud)
No, no, no—

Three dots appear. Then disappear. Then reappear.

> **MIRIAM:** "too late already here"

A knock at the door.

Maya sighs, smiles despite herself, and opens it.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

MIRIAM (late 20s, openly bisexual, wearing an oversized cardigan and doc martens) bursts in carrying takeout bags.

MIRIAM
I brought emotional support dumplings.

MAYA
You were two blocks away when you texted, weren't you?

MIRIAM
I was downstairs.
(unpacking food)
I knew you'd need this conversation.

Maya flops onto her bed. Miriam sits beside her, hands her chopsticks.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Talk to me. What's the real reason you won't submit for The Ivory Room?

MAYA
Because I'll bomb. Because I'm not good enough. Because—

MIRIAM
Because you're lying to yourself.

MAYA
(defensive)
I'm a comedian. Lying's literally my job.

MIRIAM
No. Making people feel less alone is your job. The jokes are just how you do it.
(beat)
You're scared that if you actually succeed, you'll have to stop pretending you don't want this.

Direct hit. Maya's armor cracks just slightly.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
(softer)
You know what I love about you?

MAYA
My devastating wit?

MIRIAM
The parts between the jokes. When you forget to perform. Like right now.

Maya's armor cracks. Just slightly.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
I just want more of that. The real you.

MAYA
(quietly)
What if I get there and I'm still just... the diversity booking?

MIRIAM
Then you make them laugh so hard they forget they ever saw you that way.

They sit in comfortable silence, eating dumplings.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Want to grab coffee tomorrow? I miss you. We haven't actually hung out-hung out in like two weeks.

MAYA
I know. I'm sorry. I've just been—

MIRIAM
Hiding behind your jokes?

MAYA
(small smile)
Yeah.

MIRIAM
I can't keep waiting for you to trust me.

There's weight in that sentence. Maya hears it.

MAYA
I do trust you.

MIRIAM
Do you? Because sometimes I feel like I'm dating your performance, not... you.

MAYA
That's not fair.

MIRIAM
I know.
(softer)
But it's true.

Miriam kisses Maya's forehead, stands up.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Think about The Ivory Room. And think about... us.
(heading to door)
I love you. Even the parts you won't let me see.

She leaves. Maya sits alone with her dumplings and her thoughts.

JUMP CUT TO:

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Maya at her laptop. The email about The Ivory Room still open.

She takes a breath.

Clicks.

Types:

> "I'd love the spot. Thank you."

Hits send before she can overthink it.

Her phone rings immediately. Unknown number.

MAYA
Hello?

RICHARD (V.O.)
(smooth, professional)
Maya Santos? This is Richard Chen from The Ivory Room. Got your email. How's tonight at 10pm?

MAYA
Tonight? I—

RICHARD (V.O.)
Headliner canceled. Need someone solid. Fred recommended you. You in?

Every instinct says no. Every dream says yes.

MAYA
(exhales)
I'm in.

CUT TO:

>_END OF ACT ONE_<

===

>_ACT TWO_<

EXT. THE IVORY ROOM - NIGHT

Manhattan. The club's exterior is elegant—tasteful signage, velvet rope, well-dressed people in line.

Maya approaches in her best "I belong here" outfit: black jeans, white button-up, the bomber jacket. Her armor.

She stops outside. Deep breath.

MAYA
(to herself)
Read the room. Control the room. You've done this a thousand times.

She walks in.

INT. THE IVORY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A different world from the basement clubs. Polished wood, professional lighting, a real sound system. The crowd is industry people—agents, bookers, comedy nerds.

Maya checks in at the door. The STAGE MANAGER (efficient, kind) hands her a set list.

STAGE MANAGER
You're on in twenty. Green room's downstairs. Break a leg.

INT. THE IVORY ROOM - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nicer than any green room Maya's ever seen. Actual furniture. Working bathroom. Food that isn't stale chips.

Two other comics are already there, but Maya doesn't approach them. She sits apart, running through her set in her head.

The door opens. Two men in expensive suits enter—out of place in a comedy club. They don't acknowledge the comics. Just walk to the back corner and start talking in low voices.

Maya's performer instinct kicks in: she observes them. Can't help it.

SUIT #1
(checking watch)
He's late.

SUIT #2
He'll be here. The shipment's tonight. We need this problem handled permanently.

Maya's attention sharpens. That's not comedy industry talk.

SUIT #1
And if he refuses?

SUIT #2
(cold)
Then it gets handled anyway.

They leave through a back door Maya didn't notice before.

Red flag. Every survival instinct Maya has developed flares.

But she's on in fifteen minutes. Focus.

INT. THE IVORY ROOM - STAGE - LATER

The EMCEE finishes the introduction.

EMCEE
...please welcome to The Ivory Room stage, Maya Santos!

Applause. Professional, measured.

Maya walks out. The spotlight hits her. This is it.

MAYA
Thank you! Wow, this is fancy. I usually perform in rooms where the brick is "exposed" because the landlord gave up.

Laugh. Good start.

MAYA (CONT'D)
So I was out late last night. You know, fighting crime or as my mom calls it "not giving her grandkids."

Bigger laugh. She's reading them perfectly.

MAYA (CONT'D)
People see me and they can't figure me out. Black, Filipina, queer... I'm like a diversity bingo card. 
(beat)
Except nobody wins.

The room laughs, but it's the kind of laugh that knows she's telling the truth.

MAYA (CONT'D)
My mom still introduces me to her church friends as "just very career-focused." 
(Filipino accent)
"She work so hard! No time for husband!" 
(normal voice)
Ma, I have a girlfriend. 
(accent)
"So modern!"

Wave of laughter. She's got them.

MAYA (CONT'D)
But honestly? Being "other" my whole life made me really good at reading rooms. Like, instantly. I walk in and I know: Am I too Black here? Too Asian? Too queer? Too broke?
(beat)
It's exhausting. But hey—great for comedy!
(another beat)
Terrible for my therapist's workload.

The laughs are real now. Connected. She's doing it.

MAYA (CONT'D)
You spend enough time reading rooms to survive, you start to see things other people miss. Patterns. Energy shifts. Who's a threat, who's safe.
(lightening it)
Which is just a fun way of saying I have trust issues and hyper-vigilance! 
(jazz hands)

Big laugh. She's in control.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(softer, more vulnerable)
Truth is, I've used humor my whole life as armor. If I make you laugh first, you can't hurt me. If I control the room, the room can't control me.
(beat)
That's not a joke. That's just... 
(shrugs)
...me.

The room is silent. The good kind. The listening kind.

MAYA (CONT'D)
(grinning)
But hey, at least I'm funny about it! That's gotta count for something, right?

Applause. Real, warm applause.

MAYA (CONT'D)
I'm Maya Santos. Thank you, you've been a beautiful crowd!

She walks off stage to strong applause. Adrenaline and relief flood through her.

She did it.

INT. THE IVORY ROOM - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Maya is buzzing. Other comics congratulate her. The Stage Manager gives her a thumbs up.

Then, a man in an expensive suit approaches. TALENT AGENT (40s, slick, professional smile).

TALENT AGENT
Maya Santos?

MAYA
That's me.

TALENT AGENT
You're funny. Really funny.
(hands her a business card)
Call me Monday. Let's talk about your career.

He walks away before she can process it.

Maya stares at the card. This is real. This is happening.

Then she hears voices from down the hallway—the same two suits from earlier. And a third voice.

Her instinct says: _Leave._

Her curiosity says: _Listen._

She follows the voices.

INT. THE IVORY ROOM - BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Maya moves quietly. The voices get clearer.

SUIT #1 (O.S.)
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)
(nervous)
I told you, I can't do this anymore. I want out.

SUIT #2 (O.S.)
That's not how this works.

UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)
I don't care. I'm done.

SUIT #1 (O.S.)
Then we have a problem.

Maya peeks around the corner.

The two suits. A nervous third man. And behind them, a fourth figure in a long trench coat and sunglasses indoors.

Red flags everywhere.

SUIT #2
(to Trench Coat)
Handle it.

The third man's eyes go wide.

THIRD MAN
Wait—no, please—

In one smooth motion, Trench Coat pulls out a pistol with a silencer.

**THWIP.**

The third man drops.

Maya's hand flies to her mouth. Stops the scream.

Trench Coat looks up.

Makes direct eye contact with Maya.

TRENCH COAT
(calmly)
We have a witness.

>_ACT THREE_<

# ACT THREE: MIDPOINT CRISIS

EXT. MANHATTAN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

12 EXT. MANHATTAN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 12

Maya CHARGES into the night—straight into TORRENTIAL RAIN. 
She SPRINTS across the street, dress shoes slapping wet 
pavement.

Behind her: SUIT #2. Moving with purpose.

Maya ducks into a narrow alley lined with STACKED BOXES 
and DUMPSTERS.

She STOPS. Heart hammering.

Quick scan: Exit at the far end. Stack of boxes to her 
left. Dumpster to her right. Fire escape above.

She presses against the boxes, OUT OF VIEW.

Footsteps approach. Slow. Methodical.

Maya holds her breath, one hand on the boxes—ready to 
push them if she needs to create a barrier.

The rain is deafening.

Suddenly—COLD WET DOG NOSE against her cheek.

She nearly screams—

then sees him: a soaking wet BLACK DOG, scraggly and eager, excitedly NUDGING HER FACE with enthusiasm completely inappropriate for this life-or-death moment.

MAYA
(whispering frantically)
Shhh! Quiet, boy!

She tries to KEEP BOSCO QUIET, PETTING HIM ON THE HEAD with shaking hands. Bosco's tail wags, spraying water everywhere.

SUIT #2 appears at the mouth of the alley. Stops. Looks left. Right.

Maya freezes, one hand still on Bosco's head. _Please don't bark. Please don't bark._

Bosco, miraculously, stays quiet. Just presses against her leg, panting softly.

Suit #2 stands there. Five seconds. Ten.

Unable to see where Maya went in the maze of boxes and shadows, he turns and heads back toward the club.

Maya doesn't move for a full thirty seconds. Just breathes. Processes.

_I'm alive._

Bosco licks her hand.

Then, as if he's done this a thousand times, Bosco TAKES OFF DOWN THE STREET.

MAYA
(whispering)
Hey—wait—

Bosco STOPS about half a block away, JUMPING and PAWING AT A DOOR to a small storefront. A PET STORE, dark inside.

Maya looks back toward the club. Forward at the dog.

She needs to get out of the rain. Out of view. Somewhere—anywhere—safe.

She QUICKLY FOLLOWS Bosco, looking over her shoulder every few steps.

EXT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

Maya catches up to Bosco. He's pawing at the door, tail wagging—the best game ever.

Through the rain-streaked window: pet supplies in dim light. This might be his home.

She's soaked. Terrified. Out of options.

She KNOCKS ON THE DOOR and LOOKS THROUGH THE WINDOW.

MAYA
(to Bosco)
Hey, boy... is this your home?

Bosco barks once. Tail wagging.

INT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

A LIGHT comes on in the back.

Footsteps approach.

The door opens, revealing LARA (early 30s, Asian/Latina, intense eyes, wet hair like she was already awake, wearing dark clothes). She looks at the soaking wet woman and the soaking wet dog.

MAYA
(breathless, rushed)
Uh, hi. Does he live here? May we come in out of the rain? We are soaked.

Lara's eyes flick past Maya to the street. Scanning. Assessing.

Then back to Maya's face. Reading her.

One second of calculation.

LARA
(stepping aside)
Uh, yes. Come in, come in.

Maya practically stumbles inside. Bosco trots in like he owns the place, shaking water everywhere.

Lara closes the door. Locks it. Multiple locks. That's when Maya notices: this isn't a normal pet store.

INT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

The front is normal enough—shelves of pet supplies, a dusty register. But beyond the counter, Maya can see computer monitors. Equipment. This is something else.

Lara moves to a panel of screens, checking them. On the monitors: different angles of the street outside. The alley. The club entrance.

This is a surveillance operation.

MAYA
What is this place?

LARA
(still watching screens)
Pet store.

MAYA
With security cameras?

LARA
New York. Can't be too careful.

It's a lie. They both know it. But Lara's focus is on the monitors.

On one screen: SUIT #2 emerges from the club, stands under an awning, makes a phone call. His body language is tense, frustrated.

LARA (CONT'D)
(carefully)
Why were you running?

MAYA
I... I saw something. At The Ivory Room.

Lara's attention sharpens. She turns to face Maya fully for the first time.

LARA
What did you see?

MAYA
Two men. And someone in a trench coat. They... 
(swallows)
They killed someone. Shot him. Right there in the back hallway.

LARA
And they saw you.

It's not a question.

MAYA
Yes. One of them—the one who gave the order—he chased me.

Lara's eyes flick back to the monitor showing Suit #2 on his phone.

LARA
(quietly)
That's Marcus Webb. Johnson's head of operations.
(back to Maya)
You're not safe anymore.

MAYA
I need to call the police.

LARA
No.

MAYA
What? Someone just—

LARA
You saw two well-dressed men and a professional at The Ivory Room. That club is owned by people who own the police.
(turns back to monitors)
If you call it in, you'll disappear. Just like that man.

MAYA
How do you know that?

LARA
Because I've been watching them for months.

Maya stares at her. This stranger who just let her in. Who has surveillance equipment. Who knows things.

MAYA
Who are you?

Before Lara can answer, Bosco nudges Maya's hand again. She looks down at him—at his trusting eyes, his wagging tail.

MAYA (CONT'D)
He's really your dog?

LARA
(slight smile, first hint of warmth)
He's everyone's dog. He has terrible judgment about who to trust.

Bosco wags harder, like he's proud of this assessment.

On the monitor: The Henchman gets back in a car. Drives away.

LARA (CONT'D)
He's gone. For now.

MAYA
What do I do?

Lara looks at her. Really looks at her. Sizing her up.

LARA
That depends.
(beat)
You have two options.

INT. PET STORE - CONTINUOUS

Lara gestures for Maya to sit. There's a small table in the back, clearly where Lara works. Files. Photos. Notes. The scope of whatever this is becomes clearer.

Maya sits. Lara stays standing.

LARA
Option one: I help you disappear. New city, new name, new life. You'll never do comedy again, but you'll be safe.

MAYA
And option two?

LARA
You help me take them down.

Silence. Rain pounds against the windows.

MAYA
I'm a comedian. I'm not—I can't—

LARA
You survived that chase tonight. Most people wouldn't.

MAYA
I got lucky.

LARA
No.
(sits across from her)
You read him. You anticipated his movements. You controlled the situation even while running for your life.
(beat)
That's not luck. That's skill.

MAYA
I just... I didn't want to die.

LARA
And you knew how not to. Instinctively.
(leans forward)
You spend your life reading rooms, right? Crowds? People?

MAYA
It's what I do. It's survival.

LARA
Exactly. And what you did tonight—reading your opponent, adapting in real-time, using your environment—that's the same thing.
(beat)
You've been training your whole life. You just didn't know what for.

Maya looks at the monitors. The files. The evidence of a larger conspiracy.

MAYA
Who are "they"? Really?

LARA
Mr. Johnson. He runs the largest criminal network in New York. Weapons, trafficking, corruption. All hidden behind legitimate businesses.
(gestures to files)
Comedy clubs. Talent agencies. Media outlets. The entertainment industry.
(beat)
He decides who succeeds and who disappears.

MAYA
And you're... what? Some kind of vigilante?

LARA
I'm someone who lost someone to his organization. And I'm tired of being the only one fighting back.

MAYA
I just wanted to do comedy.

LARA
You still can. But you're in the game now whether you want to be or not.
(beat)
The question is: do you run, or do you fight?

Maya stands. Paces. Bosco follows her, sensing her distress.

MAYA
If I run, I lose everything. My career, my life here, everything I've worked for.

LARA
Yes.

MAYA
If I fight, I could die.

LARA
Yes.

MAYA
Those are terrible options.

LARA
(almost smiling)
Welcome to my world.

Maya stops pacing. Looks at the monitors again. The club where she just had her big break. The streets where she's built her life. All of it corrupted.

MAYA
My whole life, I've used comedy to survive. To read rooms. To control situations before they could control me.
(turns to Lara)
What if... what if I could use that for something real?

LARA
Then let's find out what a comedian can do.

CUT TO:

>_END OF ACT THREE_<

===

>_ACT FOUR_<

INT. PET STORE - LATER

The rain has softened to a drizzle. Lara has made tea. Maya sits wrapped in a blanket, Bosco at her feet.

Lara shows her files. Photos of Johnson. His network. The scope is staggering.

MAYA
How long have you been doing this alone?

LARA
Three years. Since they killed my partner.

MAYA
I'm sorry.

LARA
(matter-of-fact)
Don't be sorry. Help me stop them.

Maya looks at the evidence. The connections. The power structure.

MAYA
So what's the plan?

LARA
First: you go home. Act normal. If they wanted you dead tonight, you'd already be dead. They're watching. Waiting to see what you do.

MAYA
That's supposed to be comforting?

LARA
No. It's tactical.
(sits across from her)
You need training. Combat, strategy, intel gathering. But you also need to keep doing comedy. Build your career. Get deeper into their world.

MAYA
You're asking me to live a double life.

LARA
I'm asking you to survive while we take them down.
(beat)
You already do this, Maya. You're already performing a version of yourself on stage, another in your real life. This is just... adding another layer.

MAYA
And you'll teach me?

LARA
I'll teach you to listen. To adapt. To strike when they don't see it coming.
(slight smile)
You already know the most important part.

MAYA
What's that?

LARA
How to read a room.

Maya almost laughs. The absurdity of it all.

But also... it makes sense.

MAYA
When do we start?

LARA
Tomorrow. Tonight, you go home. Rest. Process this.

MAYA
I don't think I can sleep.

LARA
Then work on your set. You have shows coming up, right?

MAYA
How do you know my schedule?

LARA
I've been watching you for weeks. You're good. That's why I'm taking this risk.

MAYA
You've been watching me?

LARA
I watch everyone in Johnson's orbit. You stood out.

MAYA
Because I'm funny?

LARA
Because you're honest. Even when you're joking, you tell the truth.
(beat)
That's rare. And dangerous.

Bosco stretches, yawns dramatically.

LARA (CONT'D)
(checking monitors)
Coast is clear. I'll walk you to the main street.

EXT. STREET NEAR PET STORE - MOMENTS LATER

The rain has stopped. The city glistens, washed clean.

Lara, Maya, and Bosco stand outside the shop.

LARA
You have my number now. If anything feels wrong—anything—you call me. Immediately.

MAYA
What happens next?

LARA
You live your life. Do comedy. Be Maya.
(beat)
And when you're ready, we start fighting back.

MAYA
I'm scared.

LARA
Good. Fear keeps you sharp.
(almost smiling)
Channel it into your set.

Maya starts to walk away, then turns back.

MAYA
Lara? Why are you doing this? Really?

Lara's expression shifts. Something vulnerable underneath the tactical exterior.

LARA
Because someone has to.
(beat)
And because I'm tired of being alone.

Their eyes meet. Understanding passes between them.

MAYA
Yeah. So am I.

Maya walks away. Lara watches her go. Bosco whimpers.

LARA
(to Bosco)
I know, buddy. I hope I'm right about her too.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Maya enters. Locks every lock on her door. Slides the chain.

Leans against it. Breathing.

Her phone buzzes. Text from Miriam:

> **MIRIAM:** "how'd it go tonight??"

Maya stares at the message. How can she possibly answer that?

> **MAYA:** "Good. Really good. I'll tell you everything tomorrow."

A lie. The first of many.

> **MIRIAM:** "proud of you 💕"

Maya closes her eyes. The weight of what she's chosen settling in.

She opens her notebook. Stares at blank pages.

Writes: _"What if comedy isn't just armor? What if it's a weapon?"_

INT. COMEDY CLUB - NEXT NIGHT

A different venue. Smaller. Grittier. Maya's back on her home turf.

But she's different now.

She takes the stage. The spotlight finds her.

MAYA
So last night I had the weirdest experience. Performed at this fancy club—got handed a business card, thought I made it, right?
(beat)
Then I witnessed a crime.

The audience laughs, thinking it's a setup.

MAYA (CONT'D)
No, seriously. Saw some stuff. Had this moment of... do I run? Or do I fight?
(pause)
And I thought: I've been reading rooms my whole life just to survive. Maybe it's time I read a room to win.

More laughter. They don't know she's telling the truth.

But her eyes aren't just on the laughing faces anymore. She's scanning. Reading body language. Looking for threats. Patterns. The skills she's always had, now weaponized.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Because here's the thing about being "other" your whole life—you learn to see what other people miss. You're always three steps ahead.
(beat)
You learn that control isn't about dominance. It's about timing.

The room is locked in. Connected.

MAYA (CONT'D)
And timing? 
(grins)
Timing is everything.

Applause. Strong applause.

She walks off, adrenaline pumping differently now.

INT. COMEDY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Fred is waiting.

FRED
You killed. But something's different. You're... sharper.

MAYA
(smiling)
Yeah. I guess I am.

FRED
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it. This is the Maya I knew was in there.

He walks away.

Maya's phone buzzes. Text from Lara:

> **LARA:** "Nice set. Ready to work?"

Maya looks at the message. Then at the exit. Then at her microphone in her hand.

Two lives. Starting now.

She types back:

> **MAYA:** "Let's go."

EXT. COMEDY CLUB - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Maya steps out into the night air.

Lara is waiting in the shadows, a duffel bag at her feet. Tactical. Professional.

LARA
Ready?

MAYA
(gripping her mic)
Yeah.

Lara picks up the bag. They start walking.

Bosco appears from nowhere, trots up to join them like this is completely normal.

MAYA (CONT'D)
How does he always know where you are?

LARA
(slight smile)
Dogs have instincts we don't.

They walk together—woman, woman, dog—into the neon-lit night.

Maya glances back at the comedy club one last time. Her old life.

Then forward. Toward whatever comes next.

MAYA (V.O.)
They say comedy is all about timing. Turns out, so is justice.
(beat)
I've been practicing my timing my whole life. I just didn't know what I was training for.

The three silhouettes disappear around a corner.

MAYA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Control isn't power. Connection is. And I'm done running.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

Maya enters. STOPS DEAD.

The WALL: surveillance photos, red string connections, 
maps of NYC marked with locations. Johnson's face at 
the center. A conspiracy web.

MAYA
(breathless)
This is... a lot.

LARA
(handing her a flyer)
This is just the beginning. Open mic tomorrow night. Club Johnson owns. You're performing.

MAYA
And while I'm on stage?

LARA
I'll be planting surveillance equipment in the back office.

MAYA
You want me to do stand-up... while committing a crime?

LARA
I want you to do your job. So I can do mine.

Maya looks at the flyer. Then at Lara. Then at Bosco, who wags encouragingly.

MAYA
This is insane.

LARA
(smiling)
Welcome to the team.

FADE OUT.
