FADE IN:

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Dim stage lights cut through the smoky haze of a cramped basement comedy club. Exposed brick walls are plastered with vintage comedy posters—Pryor, Carlin, Wong. A small crowd of twenty-somethings nurse overpriced beers at wobbly tables.

MAYA SANTOS stands center stage, mic in hand. Her energy is frantic, performing like she's trying to grab the audience by the collar.

MAYA
So my mom calls me every day. EVERY day. "Maya, when are you settling down?" I'm like, Ma, I can't even settle on a Netflix show—

Scattered, polite laughter. Maya's eyes dart across the crowd, desperate for validation.

MAYA (CONT'D)
And she's like, "You need stability!" I'm thinking, you know what's stable? A table. Four legs. Doesn't complain about my life choices—

Silence. One guy checks his phone. Maya's rhythm falters.

MAYA (CONT'D)
*(voice rising)*
But seriously, dating in New York is like—it's like being an assassin for hire, except nobody's hiring and you're just—you're killing time instead of targets and—

Dead air. A woman in the front row grimaces sympathetically.

The EMCEE mercifully appears stage left, slow-clapping.

EMCEE
Maya Santos, everybody! Give it up!

Anemic applause. Maya exits stage right, her plastered smile crumbling the moment she's in the wings.

>_MAIN TITLES_<

Neo-soul vocals over boom-bap beats. A Tribe Called Quest energy. Animated sequence:

- Maya's silhouette performing stand-up morphs into her throwing a punch
- Split-screen: mic stand becomes a staff, spotlight becomes streetlight
- Bosco's ears perk up, tracking movement
- Lara's fingers dance across glowing screens
- Mr. Johnson's shadow looms over a chessboard

TITLE CARD: *MAYA SANTOS: COMEDY ASSASSIN!*

===

>_ACT ONE_<

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Maya leans against a graffiti-covered wall, scrolling through her phone with shaking hands. The screen shows her set being live-tweeted:

> @ComedyScout: Santos trying too hard tonight. Lost the room by minute two. #OpenMic

She closes her eyes. Takes a breath. Her phone buzzes.

TEXT FROM LARA: *Safehouse. 20 minutes. Training.*

Maya exhales sharply, shoulders dropping.

MAYA
*(muttering)*
At least someone thinks I can get better at *something*.

She grabs her jacket—canvas with hidden inner pockets—and heads for the exit.

EXT. RAIN-SLICKED BROOKLYN STREETS - NIGHT

Maya walks through Williamsburg, sneakers splashing through puddles reflecting neon bodega signs. Her breath mists in the autumn air.

A STREET MUSICIAN plays saxophone on the corner, his melody echoing off brownstone stoops. Maya pauses, watching how he reads the sidewalk traffic—playing softer when couples pass, building energy when groups approach.

She drops a dollar in his case. He nods acknowledgment without missing a beat.

Maya continues walking, the rhythm of his playing fading behind her.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

The renovated warehouse space hums with technology. Multiple monitors display security feeds from across the city. One wall is dedicated to hand-drawn maps and photographs connected by red string—Mr. Johnson's criminal network.

LARA THOMPSON stands in the training area—padded mats, heavy bag, weapons rack disguised as modern art installation. She's dressed for work: tactical pants, tank top, hair pulled back tight.

BOSCO sits alert by the door, tail wagging as he hears Maya's footsteps approaching.

The entry system BEEPS. Maya enters, still wearing her stage outfit—high-waisted jeans, crop top, statement earrings.

LARA
You're late.

MAYA
I'm two minutes late.

LARA
Two minutes is the difference between safe and compromised.

Bosco trots over to Maya, who kneels to scratch behind his ears. His tail thumps against the floor.

MAYA
*(to Bosco)*
At least *you* don't judge my timing.

LARA
He judges everything. He just doesn't vocalize it.

Lara gestures to the training mats. Maya reluctantly stands, removing her earrings and setting them carefully on a bench.

LARA (CONT'D)
Tonight we work on close quarters combat. Reading body language. Anticipating movement.

MAYA
Can we skip to the part where I'm naturally gifted and we montage through my training?

LARA
No.

Lara moves to the center of the mat, stance balanced. Maya joins her, mimicking the position awkwardly.

LARA (CONT'D)
Attack me.

MAYA
What?

LARA
You heard me. Come at me like you mean it.

Maya hesitates, then lunges forward. Lara sidesteps effortlessly, using Maya's momentum to sweep her legs. Maya hits the mat HARD.

MAYA
*(groaning)*
Ow.

LARA
You telegraphed your entire attack. Your shoulders tensed, your eyes locked on your target, you took a breath before moving.

MAYA
So what, I'm supposed to be sneaky about it?

LARA
You're supposed to *read the moment*. Feel when the opening appears. Then strike.

Maya sits up, rubbing her hip.

MAYA
Yeah, well, reading the moment isn't exactly my strong suit tonight.

Lara extends a hand. Maya takes it, letting herself be pulled upright.

LARA
Bad set?

MAYA
They sat there like I was torturing them. I tried everything—went faster, got louder, added more punchlines—

LARA
And lost control completely.

Maya's jaw tightens.

MAYA
I didn't *lose* control. I just... couldn't *find* it.

LARA
Because you were trying to force it.

Lara walks to one of the monitors, pulling up surveillance footage. The timestamp reads three hours ago.

LARA (CONT'D)
Watch this.

The screen shows a parking garage. A large man in an expensive suit—VIKTOR KOZLOV, mid-40s, Eastern European—corners a smaller man against a car.

LARA (CONT'D)
Viktor Kozlov. Mid-level enforcer for one of Johnson's money laundering operations. That's Marcus Chen, a witness we've been trying to protect.

On screen, Viktor looms over Marcus, gesturing aggressively. Marcus shrinks back.

MAYA
What's he doing?

LARA
Performing. Watch his body language.

Viktor raises his voice, visible even without audio. He steps closer. Marcus tries to back away but there's nowhere to go.

LARA (CONT'D)
See how he's escalating? Getting louder, more physical? He's trying to intimidate Marcus into silence.

Viktor grabs Marcus's collar, shaking him. Marcus nods frantically, terrified.

LARA (CONT'D)
But watch what happens next.

A PARKING ATTENDANT rounds the corner with a clipboard. Viktor immediately releases Marcus, smoothing his suit and smiling. He pats Marcus on the shoulder like they're old friends.

The attendant passes without incident. The moment she's gone, Viktor's mask drops—but Marcus is already moving away, walking quickly toward the exit.

Viktor calls after him, frustrated. Marcus doesn't look back.

MAYA
He lost him.

LARA
Exactly. Viktor pushed too hard. Marcus was already scared—all Viktor had to do was maintain pressure. But he got aggressive, lost his rhythm. When the attendant interrupted, Marcus saw an escape route.

Lara pauses the footage on Viktor's frustrated expression.

LARA (CONT'D)
He's performing intimidation. But he's not reading his audience.

Something clicks in Maya's eyes. Her expression shifts.

MAYA
*(quietly)*
That's what I did on stage.

LARA
What?

MAYA
Tonight. I pushed too hard. Lost the rhythm. I wasn't listening to the room—I was just... performing *at* them.

She gestures at the frozen image of Viktor.

MAYA (CONT'D)
He's doing the same thing. Trying to control the situation through volume and aggression instead of—

LARA
Instead of reading what the room actually needs.

Maya nods slowly, processing.

LARA (CONT'D)
So how do you fix it?

MAYA
You listen. You find the rhythm. Then you strike when you have control.

Lara's expression softens—the closest thing to a smile she allows herself.

LARA
Again.

She moves back to the training mat. This time, when Maya attacks, she's quieter. Watching. When Lara begins to shift her weight, Maya adjusts mid-movement, slipping past Lara's guard.

It's not perfect—Lara still counters easily—but it's *different*.

LARA (CONT'D)
Better.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - TRAINING AREA - LATER

Maya sits on the mat, drenched in sweat, gulping water from a bottle. Bosco lies beside her, panting sympathetically.

Lara reviews footage on her tablet—the same money laundering operation Viktor works for.

LARA
The operation runs out of a check cashing business in Bushwick. Front for moving illegal funds through fake accounts.

MAYA
*(still catching her breath)*
And we're... what? Shutting it down?

LARA
You are. I'll handle surveillance and backup.

MAYA
Me? Alone?

LARA
You need field experience. This is low-stakes—three people in the building, minimal security, isolated location.

She hands the tablet to Maya, who scrolls through the intel: floor plans, employee schedules, entry points.

MAYA
When?

LARA
Tomorrow night. Gives us time to run scenarios.

Maya sets down the tablet, her hands shaking slightly.

MAYA
What if I mess up? What if I freeze?

LARA
Then you adapt. Read the room. Find the rhythm.

MAYA
Easy for you to say. You don't freeze.

LARA
*(sharp)*
Everyone freezes. The question is what you do after.

There's weight behind her words—personal history she's not ready to share. Maya senses it but doesn't push.

LARA (CONT'D)
Go home. Get sleep. Tomorrow we prep.

Maya stands, every muscle protesting. Bosco stretches and follows her to the door.

MAYA
*(to Bosco)*
You staying here tonight?

Bosco looks between Maya and Lara, then trots back to Lara's side. Maya smiles despite herself.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Traitor.

LARA
He's practical. I have better treats.

As Maya reaches the door:

LARA (CONT'D)
Maya.

She turns back.

LARA (CONT'D)
You didn't lose that crowd because you're bad at comedy. You lost them because you stopped being honest.

Maya absorbs this. Nods once. Leaves.

Lara watches her go, then returns to her screens. Bosco rests his head on her knee. She absently scratches his ears, lost in thought.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

A modest studio in Bed-Stuy. Posters of comedy legends share wall space with family photos—Maya as a kid with her Filipino mother and Black father, younger siblings in various stages of adolescence.

Maya lies in bed, staring at her ceiling. Her phone sits on her chest.

She opens Instagram. Her notifications are quiet—a few followers from tonight's set, some likes on an old post.

She switches to her Notes app, where she keeps joke fragments:

> "Dating apps are just RPGs where everyone's lying about their character stats"
> 
> "My therapist says I have control issues. I said that's not true and also can we move my appointment to a time that works better for me?"
> 
> "Being an adult is just figuring out which bills you can ignore this month without consequences"

She scrolls past them all. Opens a blank note. Types:

> "I bombed tonight because I was scared of the silence. So I filled it with noise instead of truth."

She deletes it. Rewrites:

> "What if the room isn't the problem? What if I am?"

Her finger hovers over the delete button. She leaves it. Locks her phone.

Sets an alarm for tomorrow.

Closes her eyes.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT (NEXT EVENING)

The same club, different crowd. FRED WILLIAMS sits at the bar in civilian clothes—button-down shirt, no costume—nursing a whiskey.

Maya approaches nervously, comedy notebook under her arm.

FRED
Back for round two?

MAYA
Something like that.

She sits beside him. The bartender automatically pours her a soda water—her usual.

FRED
Rough night yesterday?

MAYA
You saw?

FRED
I see everything in this place. Comes with breaking through in the '80s—you develop pattern recognition.

He takes a slow sip.

FRED (CONT'D)
You know what your problem is?

MAYA
Please, tell me. I have a list going.

FRED
You're funny because you're scared. But you won't let the audience see the scared part—you only show them the funny.

MAYA
Isn't that... the point?

FRED
The point is truth. Funny is just how we package it so it doesn't hurt as much going down.

He gestures at the stage, where another comedian is setting up.

FRED (CONT'D)
You watch them laugh at someone else's pain, you start to think comedy is armor. But it's not. It's a scalpel. You gotta cut yourself open first before you can cut them.

MAYA
That sounds incredibly painful.

FRED
It is. But if you do it right, when they laugh, they're laughing *with* you. Not at you.

The stage lights come up. The comedian begins their set—raw, vulnerable material about addiction and recovery. The crowd is riveted.

FRED (CONT'D)
See that? He's terrified up there. But he's *honest* about the terror. That's the difference.

Maya watches, studying the comedian's rhythm, the way the audience leans in during the quiet moments.

FRED (CONT'D)
You're getting better at the fight. Now work on the honesty.

He finishes his drink and stands, patting her shoulder.

FRED (CONT'D)
Good luck tonight.

MAYA
I'm not performing tonight.

FRED
I know. I meant with whatever else you're doing that you won't talk about.

He walks away before she can respond.

Maya stares after him, then down at her notebook. Opens to a fresh page.

Starts writing.

> MONTAGE: PREPARATION

90s hip-hop instrumental. EPMD energy—confident bass, sharp snares.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - DAY

Lara and Maya review the operation plan. Floor layouts spread across the table. Red marker traces entry and exit routes.

LARA
Three guards. Rotating shifts. Blind spot in the loading dock camera coverage at 11:47 PM.

MAYA
That's... very specific.

LARA
Specific keeps you alive.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - TRAINING AREA - DAY

Maya practices hand-to-hand combinations on the heavy bag. Her form is improving—less wild swinging, more controlled strikes.

Lara watches, calling corrections:

LARA
Breathe. You're holding your breath.

Maya adjusts. Her next combination flows better.

Bosco sits nearby, head tilted, tracking her movements.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - TECH AREA - EVENING

Lara fits Maya with a small earpiece communicator.

LARA
Test.

MAYA
Testing, one two, is this thing on?

LARA
Stop.

MAYA
Sorry. Comedian instincts.

Lara pulls up live feeds from the check cashing business.

LARA
I'll have eyes on you the whole time. If anything goes wrong—

MAYA
You pull me out. I know.

LARA
No. If anything goes wrong, you *adapt*. I'm backup, not a safety net.

Maya swallows hard. Nods.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Maya lays out her outfit: dark jeans, black hoodie, running shoes. Her "work clothes."

She looks at herself in the mirror. Takes a breath.

Her phone buzzes. Text from her mom:

> "Kumusta anak? Haven't heard from you. Are you eating?"

Maya smiles despite her nerves. Types back:

> "I'm good, Ma. Eating plenty. Love you."

She pockets the phone.

One more breath.

Time to work.

> END MONTAGE

===

ACT TWO

EXT. BUSHWICK STREETS - NIGHT

Industrial area. Warehouses and auto body shops closed for the night. Sparse streetlights create pools of orange glow in the darkness.

Maya approaches the check cashing business—a squat building with barred windows and a flickering neon sign.

She wears a dark baseball cap, hair tucked up. Hands in her hoodie pockets.

LARA (V.O.)
*(through earpiece)*
I have you on satellite. Two guards inside—front desk and back office. Third one stepped out for a smoke break.

MAYA
*(quietly)*
Where?

LARA (V.O.)
West side alley. You have ninety seconds before he finishes.

Maya moves to the loading dock, finding the camera blind spot exactly where Lara indicated.

She picks the lock—a skill Lara's been teaching her—with surprising efficiency.

MAYA
*(whisper)*
I'm in.

INT. CHECK CASHING BUSINESS - LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

Dim emergency lighting. Boxes stacked on pallets. The smell of old paper and stale coffee.

Maya creeps forward, staying low. Voices drift from the front area—two men arguing about a basketball game.

She moves toward the back office, where the actual laundering happens.

LARA (V.O.)
*(earpiece)*
Camera in three... two...

Maya ducks behind a filing cabinet just as a security camera pans past.

LARA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Clear. Thirty seconds.

Maya slips into:

INT. CHECK CASHING BUSINESS - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Cluttered desk, ancient computer, filing cabinets. The real work happens here—ledgers showing legitimate and illegal transactions side by side.

Maya pulls out a USB drive—Lara's design, auto-executes on insertion.

She moves to the computer, plugging it in. A progress bar appears: *UPLOADING... 15%*

Footsteps in the hallway.

Maya freezes.

GUARD 1 (O.S.)
Yeah, I'm grabbing the thing from the office. Boss wants the Friday numbers.

The doorknob turns.

Maya's eyes dart around the room. Nowhere to hide that won't be immediately obvious.

*20% uploaded.*

The door opens.

GUARD 1, mid-30s, stocky, stops short when he sees Maya standing by the computer.

GUARD 1
The hell—

MAYA
*(instinct kicks in)*
Oh thank god, I've been looking everywhere for someone.

Her voice shifts—panicked, helpless. The guard's aggression wavers into confusion.

GUARD 1
How did you—

MAYA
The door was open, I thought this was—my boyfriend works in this building and we had this huge fight and he said meet him here but I think I got the wrong—

She gestures frantically, moving slightly away from the computer. Drawing his attention.

*35% uploaded.*

GUARD 1
Lady, you need to leave. This is private property.

MAYA
I know, I'm so sorry, I'm just—is there a bathroom? I've been crying and my makeup is everywhere and I really don't want to see him looking like—

She dabs at her eyes, channeling every bad breakup she's actually had.

The guard's expression softens slightly. He's dealt with relationship drama before.

GUARD 1
Look, just... bathroom's in the front. Then you gotta go, alright?

MAYA
Thank you so much. You're literally saving my life right now.

She moves toward the door, passing him. As she does:

*55% uploaded.*

GUARD 1
Wait—why's the computer on?

Maya's stomach drops.

MAYA
*(turning back)*
Oh, I thought maybe I could look up the building directory? To find the right office?

It's a terrible lie. She knows it. He knows it.

GUARD 1
*(suspicion returning)*
What building directory?

*70% uploaded.*

The guard moves toward the computer.

LARA (V.O.)
*(earpiece, urgent)*
Maya. Adapt.

Maya reads the room. The guard is bigger, trained, armed. Fighting him here means noise. Noise means the other guards. The whole operation fails.

But she sees it—the way he's moving toward the desk, his body turned away from her. The way his radio is clipped to his belt, within reach.

She steps closer, hand moving to his belt.

MAYA
I'm really sorry about this.

She grabs the radio, ripping it free. He spins, reaching for her.

Maya doesn't fight him head-on. She reads his movement—the way Lara taught her—and uses his own momentum.

As he lunges, she sidesteps, hooking her foot behind his ankle.

He goes down HARD, hitting the floor with a grunt.

*90% uploaded.*

Maya doesn't wait. She grabs a desk lamp, yanking the cord from the wall, and uses it to tie his hands to the radiator pipe.

GUARD 1
What the—you can't—

She stuffs his own tie in his mouth as a gag.

*100% uploaded.*

Maya grabs the USB drive, pockets it, and runs.

INT. CHECK CASHING BUSINESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Voices from the front area—the other guards heard the commotion.

GUARD 2 (O.S.)
Tony? You good back there?

Maya sprints toward the loading dock.

LARA (V.O.)
*(earpiece)*
Smoke break guard just came back inside. He's heading your direction.

MAYA
*(running)*
Little busy right now—

She rounds the corner and nearly collides with GUARD 3—the smoker, smelling of cigarettes and cheap cologne.

He grabs for her. Maya ducks, using his surprise against him.

She drives her palm into his solar plexus—exactly like Lara taught her—and he doubles over, gasping.

She doesn't stop running.

EXT. CHECK CASHING BUSINESS - LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

Maya bursts out into the night, sprinting across the parking lot.

Behind her, shouts from inside the building.

She vaults a chain-link fence—messier than it looked in movies, her hoodie catching on the top—and hits the street running.

LARA (V.O.)
*(earpiece)*
East two blocks. Black sedan.

Maya runs, lungs burning, until she sees the car. Lara is already behind the wheel, engine running.

Maya throws herself into the passenger seat.

LARA
Drive.

The car pulls away smoothly, no screeching tires, nothing to draw attention.

In the distance, sirens begin to wail.

INT. LARA'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Maya is shaking, adrenaline flooding her system. She holds up the USB drive like a trophy.

MAYA
I got it.

LARA
I saw.

MAYA
Did you see the part where I—

LARA
Adapted. Yes.

Lara's tone is neutral, but there's something underneath it. Not quite pride. But close.

LARA (CONT'D)
The guard you tied up?

MAYA
Yeah?

LARA
Sloppy knots. He'll be free in ten minutes.

MAYA
Are you *serious* right now—

LARA
But you read the room. Didn't escalate. Got what you needed and left.

She glances at Maya.

LARA (CONT'D)
That's good work.

Maya leans back in the seat, eyes closed, trying to slow her racing heart.

MAYA
I think I'm gonna throw up.

LARA
Not in my car.

Despite everything, Maya laughs.

===

ACT THREE

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER

The late-night crowd is smaller, drunker, more forgiving. Maya stands backstage, watching another comedian finish their set.

Her hands aren't shaking anymore.

The emcee approaches.

EMCEE
You're up next. You good?

MAYA
Yeah. I think so.

EMCEE
Cool. Less existential dread than yesterday?

MAYA
We'll see.

She takes the stage.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The lights are warm on Maya's face. She adjusts the mic stand, taking her time.

MAYA
Hi. I'm Maya.

Scattered hellos from the crowd.

MAYA (CONT'D)
I bombed here yesterday. Like, *spectacularly*. I tried every trick—went faster, got louder, threw in more punchlines. But I forgot the most important thing.

She pauses. Scans the room.

MAYA (CONT'D)
I forgot to listen.

Beat.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Comedy is supposed to be a conversation, right? But I was up here having a full monologue at you. Like that friend who texts you their entire day before you've even said good morning.

A few chuckles. Maya feels the room shift slightly.

MAYA (CONT'D)
And the thing is—I do this in my real life too. When I'm scared, I just... fill the silence. I had a first date last week, and the guy barely got three words in before I'd already told him my entire medical history, my sister's drama, and my controversial opinions on pineapple pizza.

Laughter. Genuine this time.

MAYA (CONT'D)
He did not call me back.

More laughter.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Which is fair. Because I didn't give him space to be a person. I just needed him to laugh so I'd know I was okay.

The room is quiet, but it's a different kind of quiet. They're listening.

MAYA (CONT'D)
But the thing I'm learning is—you can't control how people respond to you. You can only control how honest you're willing to be.

She looks out at the crowd. Really sees them.

MAYA (CONT'D)
So here's the truth: I'm terrified right now. I'm terrified you won't like me. I'm terrified I'm wasting my life doing this instead of something practical. I'm terrified my mom is right and I should've gone to dental school.

Big laugh.

MAYA (CONT'D)
But I'm more terrified of going through life pretending I'm not scared. Because that's exhausting. And also? It's bad comedy.

She lets the moment breathe.

MAYA (CONT'D)
Anyway. That's where I'm at. Thanks for listening.

The applause is warm. Not thunderous—but real.

As Maya exits the stage, she catches Fred's eye at the bar. He raises his glass in silent approval.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

Maya enters to find Lara reviewing the data from the USB drive. Multiple spreadsheets and financial records scroll across the monitors.

Bosco immediately trots over, tail wagging.

MAYA
Hey, buddy.

She kneels, scratching behind his ears. He leans into her hand, eyes half-closed in contentment.

LARA
*(not looking away from screens)*
How was the set?

MAYA
Better. Not great. But better.

LARA
Progress.

MAYA
Did you find anything?

LARA
Three shell companies. All connected to Johnson's network. This is going to hurt him.

She pulls up a new window—a news article about a city councilman under investigation for corruption.

LARA (CONT'D)
And this councilman? He's been blocking the investigation. Guess who's been paying his campaign fund?

Maya leans in, reading over Lara's shoulder.

MAYA
One of the shell companies.

LARA
Exactly. We can't touch Johnson directly yet. But we can dismantle his support system.

MAYA
One operation at a time.

LARA
One operation at a time.

Bosco nudges Maya's hand with his wet nose—a gentle demand for more attention.

MAYA
*(to Bosco)*
I didn't forget you. Promise.

She sits on the floor, legs crossed. Bosco immediately curls up against her, resting his head on her knee.

MAYA (CONT'D)
You know what Lara said earlier? About Bosco reading me?

LARA
*(still typing)*
I said dogs have instincts we don't.

MAYA
You said he's reading me. That's what I need to do on stage.

Lara's typing slows. She turns in her chair.

LARA
And?

MAYA
And I tried it tonight. Just... watching the room. Listening to what they actually needed instead of what I wanted to give them.

LARA
How did it feel?

MAYA
Terrifying.

Beat.

MAYA (CONT'D)
And kind of amazing.

Lara almost smiles.

LARA
That's the difference between performing and connecting.

MAYA
Is that why you do this? The vigilante thing? Because you're connecting with—I don't know—justice?

LARA
*(carefully)*
I do this because someone has to. And because I couldn't live with myself if I looked away.

MAYA
Even though it's dangerous?

LARA
Especially because it's dangerous.

They sit in comfortable silence. Bosco's breathing deepens—he's falling asleep.

MAYA
He trusts me.

LARA
He does.

MAYA
Why?

LARA
Because you're honest with him. Even when you're scared, you don't hide it. He can feel that.

Maya looks down at Bosco, his warm weight against her leg.

MAYA
I wish people were that easy.

LARA
They're not. But the principle is the same. Honesty builds trust. Trust builds connection.

MAYA
Is that what we're doing? Building trust?

LARA
We're trying.

Fred's words echo in Maya's mind: *You're getting better at the fight. Now work on the honesty.*

MAYA
Lara?

LARA
Mm?

MAYA
Why did you really bring me into this? It wasn't just because I witnessed a murder.

Lara's jaw tightens. For a moment, Maya thinks she won't answer.

LARA
*(quiet)*
Because when I saw you on that stage—the way you read that crowd, the way you adapted when a joke didn't land—I saw someone who understands what I do. Just in a different context.

MAYA
And?

LARA
And I've been doing this alone for a long time. Maybe... maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

It's the most vulnerable Maya has ever heard her.

MAYA
I'm not you. I'm not as good at this.

LARA
You're good at different things. That's why it works.

Bosco shifts in his sleep, stretching out across both their laps now—a bridge between them.

MAYA
He's going to be impossible to move.

LARA
Then don't move him.

Lara reaches over, scratching Bosco's belly. He makes a contented sound without waking.

LARA (CONT'D)
Get some rest. Tomorrow we go through the data and plan the next move.

MAYA
More training?

LARA
Always more training.

MAYA
Great. My body already hates me.

But she's smiling.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - LATER

Maya has fallen asleep on the couch, Bosco still curled against her. Her breathing is slow and steady.

Lara works quietly at her monitors, the glow illuminating her face in the darkness.

She glances over at Maya and Bosco. Something softens in her expression.

She stands, grabbing a blanket from a storage ottoman. Carefully, she drapes it over both of them.

Bosco's tail thumps once in acknowledgment but he doesn't wake.

Lara returns to her screens, pulling up the financial data again. Red lines connecting shell companies to city officials to criminal enterprises.

The web is vast. But piece by piece, they're dismantling it.

She opens a new window—a secure message to an anonymous contact:

> "Package delivered. Johnson's infrastructure compromised. Proceeding to next target."

The response comes almost immediately:

> "Understood. Be careful. He's watching."

Lara deletes the conversation. Runs a program that scrubs any trace of it from her system.

She looks back at Maya and Bosco—her found family, fragile and precious.

LARA
*(whisper)*
I will be.

> FINAL MONTAGE

Neo-soul ballad. Lauryn Hill vibes. Raw, vulnerable, unfiltered.

INT. THE COMEDY BASEMENT - NIGHT

Maya on stage again, a week later. Different crowd. She's looser now, more present. The laughter comes easier.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - TRAINING AREA - DAY

Maya and Lara sparring. Maya lands a clean hit—Lara actually has to block. They both pause, surprised.

LARA
Good.

MAYA
I know, right?

They continue. The rhythm between them is improving.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING

Maya walks Bosco through the neighborhood. He stops to sniff everything. She doesn't rush him.

A kid on a bike nearly clips them. Bosco growls protectively.

MAYA
It's okay. We're okay.

Bosco relaxes. Trusts her judgment.

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Maya FaceTimes with her mother—a warm Filipina woman in her 50s, MAYA'S MOM.

MAYA'S MOM
You look tired, anak.

MAYA
I'm good, Ma. Just busy.

MAYA'S MOM
Busy with what? Comedy doesn't pay bills.

MAYA
I know. But I'm figuring it out.

Her mom studies her through the screen.

MAYA'S MOM
You look... different. Stronger, maybe.

MAYA
Yeah. Maybe.

MAYA'S MOM
Just be safe. Whatever you're doing.

MAYA
I will. Promise.

They blow each other kisses. The call ends.

Maya looks at her reflection in the darkened phone screen.

She looks tired. But she also looks alive.

INT. LARA'S SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

Maya, Lara, and Bosco on the couch. Takeout containers spread across the coffee table. A movie plays on one of the monitors—an old action film, subtitles in three languages.

Bosco is sprawled across both their laps, snoring softly.

LARA
He's your dog now, you know.

MAYA
What?

LARA
He chose you. That's how it works.

MAYA
I can barely take care of myself.

LARA
Then you'll figure it out together.

Maya looks down at Bosco, his peaceful sleeping face.

MAYA
Yeah. I guess we will.

The camera slowly pulls back, widening to show the three of them—vigilante, comedian, dog—building something that looks almost like family.

> END MONTAGE

FADE TO BLACK.

> TAG SCENE

INT. MR. JOHNSON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Luxury penthouse overlooking Manhattan. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Modern art that costs more than most people's homes.

MR. JOHNSON sits behind a massive desk, reading a report on his tablet. His expression is unreadable.

His ASSISTANT enters—nervous, young, expensive suit.

ASSISTANT
Sir, there's been another breach. The Bushwick operation.

JOHNSON
*(not looking up)*
I'm aware.

ASSISTANT
They got the financial records. If that data goes public—

JOHNSON
It won't.

He sets down the tablet, finally looking at his assistant.

JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Someone is trying to send me a message. Amateur work, but persistent.

ASSISTANT
Do we know who?

JOHNSON
Not yet. But we will.

He opens a drawer, pulling out a photograph. It's surveillance footage—blurry, but clearly Maya running from the check cashing business.

JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Find out everything about this woman. Who she is. Where she lives. What matters to her.

ASSISTANT
And then?

Johnson's expression doesn't change. But something cold flickers in his eyes.

JOHNSON
Then we remind her what happens when people interfere in my business.

He slides the photo across the desk.

JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Everyone has a pressure point. We just need to find hers.

FADE TO BLACK.
